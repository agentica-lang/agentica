## 4. Standard library and function values (phases 5f2–5m)

Fixed here so each roadmap phase can take it as its specification. Named function values (5j) now ship in the core; their normative grammar is in `grammar.md`. Typed JSON, builders/schema, and file imports also ship in the core; remaining extensions stay planned.

```ebnf
postfix_expr     = primary, { ".", NAME
                            | ".", "call", "(", [ arguments ], ")"
                            | "[", expression, "]" } ;

primary          = (* …core forms, plus: *)
                 | "&", NAME
                 | TYPE_NAME ; (* core JSON.decode/schema type arguments *)
```

- **`&name` and `.call(...)`:** `&name` turns a top-level function into a value of type `Fn[...]`, and `value.call(args)` calls it. `call` is not a reserved word: it has this meaning only right after a `.` and before `(`. There are no closures: `&name` does not capture variables. The checker requires `name` to be a declared function and compares parameters and return type with the expected type. Precedence 1, like the named call.
- **Bare type names:** core JSON.decode/schema arguments include imported types such as Models.User. Types are not runtime values.
- Function values, `Void`, `Process`, and TCP/TLS/HTTP handles and records are core; their normative APIs live in grammar.md. Opaque handles have no constructor or fields; inspect prints a type marker.
- `Void`, `Process`, `Fn`, `BDD`, `Json`, `JSON`, `Task`, `TCP`, `TLS`, `HTTP` and networking types are reserved in the core; typed decoding and schema functions are core.

```ruby
def double(n: Int) -> Int
  return n * 2
end

def main() -> Void
  f: Fn[Int, Int] = &double
  puts(String.from_int(f.call(21)))
  if String.contains?("agentica", "gent")
    puts("found")
  end
end
```

Programs that phase must reject:

```ruby
x = User               # A type is valid only as an argument of JSON.decode or JSON.schema.
f = &missing           # &name requires a declared function.
ready = done?          # A function name is not a value; use &done?.
```

Typed JSON decoding, builders/schema, and file imports/exports now ship in the
core; their normative contracts live in grammar.md and the programming reference.
