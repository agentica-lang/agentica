## 5. Remaining `List` operations

The collection module is `List`, keeping `List.size`; the earlier `Enum` proposal is superseded. Phase 5n already implements `List.append`, `List.set`, `List.repeat`, `List.reverse`, `List.concat/take/drop/at`, `List.map/filter/reduce`, `List.sort/sort_by`, and `Map.values/get/delete`. Their current contracts live in `grammar.md` and the programming reference. Knight-tour and small traveling-salesman examples exercise construction, persistent updates, and nested lists. Operations below remain planned, not part of the implemented core. `List.sum` and more Enumerable methods are now planned in [section 25.6](25-ruby-typed-idioms.md#256-more-enumerable-methods).

Remaining callback operations depend on function values (section 4, phase 5j): `List.any?` and `List.all?`. Without closures, a function cannot capture variables; extra state travels through parameters or the accumulator.

```text
List.sum(list: List[N]) -> N        # N is Int or Float; see section 25.6
List.member?(list: List[T], item: T) -> Bool
List.any?(list: List[A], f: Fn[A, Bool]) -> Bool
List.all?(list: List[A], f: Fn[A, Bool]) -> Bool
```

Planned rules:

- Generic builtins, no user generics. Collection operations preserve their inputs.
- `List.member?` requires primitive equality; wider equality (structs, lists, maps, enums, Results) is planned in [section 25.4](25-ruby-typed-idioms.md#254-value-equality-for-data).
- Callbacks require exact parameter and return types.
- `List.size` remains the count operation; no duplicate `count` alias is planned.
- Linked-list operations remain linear; repeated append costs O(n²). A persistent vector is a later optimization.

Future example, after function values and the remaining operations land:

```ruby
def double(n: Int) -> Int
  return n * 2
end

def add(total: Int, n: Int) -> Int
  return total + n
end

def main() -> Void
  numbers = [3, 1, 2]
  sorted = List.sort(numbers)
  doubled = List.map(sorted, &double)
  puts(String.from_int(List.reduce(doubled, 0, &add)))
end
```

Continue primitive operations through the builtins catalog. Function values (5j) are now available, but collection callbacks remain pending; keep checker, evaluator, grammar, and programming reference in sync when adding them.

### Other gaps for code-challenge programs

Besides remaining List operations, these gaps remain. Check each against a real task before building it.

- **Math:** `abs`, `min`, `max`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceil`, `gcd`.
- **Ranges, sets and queues:** ranges are in `grammar.md` (8a); sets and queues are planned in [section 12](12-data-structures.md#12-data-structures). Meanwhile use `Map[T, Bool]` and `std/queue`.
- **Input:** a helper for lines of integers; IO.gets/IO.gets!, Result, and try already handle line reads and EOF.
- **Structures:** tuples or pairs ([section 12.5](12-data-structures.md#125-later)). Nested lists and matrices are exercised by the traveling-salesman example.
- **Performance:** `List.append` copies the list, so repeated appends are O(n²); a persistent vector is planned in [section 12.4](12-data-structures.md#124-faster-lists). Maps already use Racket immutable hashes with structural sharing ("Faster maps" in the roadmap).
- **Bounds:** Int is signed 64-bit and recursion has a 10000-call limit. Large challenge workloads still need practical runtime measurements.
- **Outside the language:** online judges do not accept Agentica, so challenges run locally against hidden cases, as in `tests/eval/`. The interpreter is a tree walker on Racket, so judge time limits are tight.
