# Front-end recipes and Racket gotchas

Step lists for common front-end changes (keyword, AST node, syntax, diagnostic, stage, tests), the Racket and lexer gotchas of this repo, and how to read a failure. Read before editing `src/*.rkt`.

## Common tasks

### Add a keyword or operator

1. Add it to the `keywords` hash (reserved words) or the operator hash in `src/lexer.rkt`.
2. If the parser must act on it, add the kind to the relevant `case`/`memq` in `src/parser.rkt`.
3. Add a test in `tests/lexer-test.rkt` (kinds) and, when it affects syntax, `tests/parser-test.rkt`.
4. Run `raco test tests/`.

### Add an AST node

1. Add a `#:transparent` struct in `src/ast.rkt` with `span` as the last field, and add `(struct-out <node>)` to `provide`.
2. Construct it in `src/parser.rkt` and set the span from the first token to the last consumed token (the existing `span-from` helper).
3. Test the node's fields and its span line/column.

### Add syntax

1. Add tokens first if the syntax needs them.
2. Add the AST node if no existing node fits.
3. Write a parse function and call it from the right place: `parse-statement` for statements, `parse-primary` for expressions, `parse-program` for declarations.
4. Add one valid test and one rejection test asserting the diagnostic code.
5. Run `raco test tests/` and the smoke test.

### Add a diagnostic code

1. Choose the stage prefix: `LEX-`, `PARSE-`, later `CHECK-` or `RUNTIME-`.
2. Raise it with the stage's `bail`/`fail` helper and a token or position span.
3. Test both the code and the location (`source-position-line`/`-column` of the diagnostic span), as `tests/parser-test.rkt` does.

### Add a pipeline stage

1. Create `src/<stage>.rkt` with one entry point and a `provide`.
2. Require the previous stage's data modules only; do not reach back into the CLI.
3. Wire it into `src/main.rkt` after the previous stage, behind a `diagnostic?` guard.
4. Add `tests/<stage>-test.rkt`. `raco test tests/` discovers it automatically; CI needs no change.

### Add tests

- Use `#lang racket`, `rackunit`, and `module+ test` with `test-case` blocks.
- Require sources with relative paths (`"../src/lexer.rkt"`); they resolve from the test file.
- Keep the small helpers pattern from `tests/parser-test.rkt`: `parse-ok` fails loudly when a valid input returns a diagnostic, and `parse-code` returns the code or fails when invalid input parses.
- Cover the happy path, the error path, and the specific behavior the change introduces.

## Racket gotchas

- `define` is not allowed in an expression context, and `(begin ...)` is an expression. `(begin (define x 1) ...)` fails with `define: not allowed in an expression context`. Use `(let () ...)` to open a body that allows internal defines. `cond`/`case` clause bodies, `let/ec` bodies, and lambda bodies already allow them.
- `define` binds like `letrec`. A local named the same as the accessor it calls, such as `(define param-type (param-type x))`, fails with `undefined; cannot use before initialization`. Name locals distinctly.
- `source` is opaque (no `#:transparent`), so printing a tree shows `#<source>` instead of repeating the file text; every other struct is `#:transparent`. Keep any struct that holds the whole source text opaque.
- The lexer and parser are single mutable-pass scanners driven by `set!`. The parser cursor is capped at the last token (`EOF`), so `advance!` never runs past the end and `current`/`peek-token` stay safe at EOF.
- Early exit uses `let/ec` with a `bail`/`return` helper that escapes with a `diagnostic`. This is how a stage stops at the first error.
- `provide (struct-out name)` exports the constructor, predicate, and accessors in one line.
- `#lang racket` provides `pretty-print`; `src/main.rkt` uses it for `--dump`.
- `unary` and `binary` carry `op-span` (the operator token) beside `span`. Operator diagnostics use `op-span`; `node-span` in `ast.rkt` returns any node's span.
- Racket `equal?` treats `+nan.0` as equal to itself and `0.0` unequal to `-0.0`; compare numbers with `=` so `==` follows IEEE 754.
- Positions count Racket string characters, line and column are 1-based, and span ends are exclusive. Keep that convention in new spans.

## Lexer gotcha: stray NL tokens

The lexer emits one `NL` per LF/CRLF outside `()`, `[]`, and `{}`, including every blank/comment line, so extra lines between statements can leave more than one `NL` token. The grammar's `program` and `block` rules do not model this. The parser therefore skips stray `NL` at the top level and between statements. Keep that skip when adding statement forms, or valid files with comments between statements will fail to parse.

Top-level declarations need a blank line after their `end` (`PARSE-MISSING-BLANK-LINE`, checked in `parse-program` from the NL tokens). A `##` doc block is one `DOC` token followed by the `NL` of its last line, and it does not count as a blank line: the check also fires when the next token is a `DOC`. A blank line and a `#` comment line both give one `NL`, so a `DOC` token carries what follows it (`doc-block-next`) for the module-doc rule. The rule only fires when the next token starts a declaration or import, so stray text after `end` stays `PARSE-TOP-LEVEL-STATEMENT`. Inline test programs end each top-level `end` with `end\n\n`, so fragments can be joined safely.

## Error handling

- `raco test tests/` failure: read the failing `test-case` name and the message from the `parse-ok`/`parse-code` helper. A `parse-ok` failure prints the diagnostic the stage returned.
- Smoke test exits 1: `main.rkt` printed `file:line:column error[CODE]`, the message, and a source excerpt with a caret on stderr. That is a stage diagnostic, not a crash.
- A Racket traceback instead of a diagnostic means a stage raised or indexed out of range. Find the token or index and turn it into a `bail`/`fail`; the roadmap requires Agentica diagnostics, never host tracebacks.
- A stage unexpectedly returns a diagnostic: check the first-error rule and that `main.rkt` guards with `diagnostic?` before passing data to the next stage.
